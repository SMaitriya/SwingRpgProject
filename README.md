Game Textual version:

The game starts by allowing the player to choose a name and select a class—Mage, Warrior, or Archer. Each class has unique characteristics and a special attack that consumes either energy, arrows, or mana. After choosing a class, the player can purchase a starting weapon from a list tailored to their chosen class. Once equipped, the player is placed on a map filled with monsters, obstacles, and a shop. The player can navigate the map, encountering monsters or obstacles. When facing a monster, the player can use either a standard attack or their class-specific special attack that cost either mana , energy or arrows. If defeated, it’s game over. Upon victory, the player earns health and gold. The map’s shop allows the player to buy new weapons using accumulated gold. The game ends when the player either reaches the exit or is defeated by a monster.

After equipping their weapon, the player is placed on a game map filled with monsters, obstacles, and a shop. The player can navigate the map, encountering monsters or obstacles (such as rocks that block movement).

The shop on the map allows the player to purchase new weapons with the gold they’ve accumulated. The player’s gold and inventory are updated in real-time, reflecting any purchases or changes during gameplay.

The game continues as the player explores the map and tries to reach the exit. If the player successfully reaches the exit, they win the game.

The movement system ensures that the player cannot pass through obstacles (like rocks) and can only travel to spaces that are not blocked.

Note: The monster fight mechanics have not yet been implemented.
